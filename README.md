# Meltmedia Technical Assessment

### By: Jordan Pagni

Hey Meltmedia team! For this technical assessment I recreated the given jpeg/psd file using css and html.  One route I considered taking was using react and stateless components but it seemed like overkill for a project in which html and css would do the trick.

I combined some layers in the psd file to create simple png images where I though it did not make sense to have them separated further, e.g. combining the separate components of the 'get in touch' box into one image.

To run the code simply double click the html file and a browser should open with the static page.  I added a few breakpoints for different size windows to hold the integrity and quality of the page being viewed.
